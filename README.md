Roulette martingale simulator is a simple desktop app that emulates big numbers of roulette games, in which a player tries his luck using martingale betting system.
Martingale system is straight-forward: you double down after every loss and go back to initial bet after every win.
While this strategy can lead to seemingly easy short term returns, it turns out that in the long run game is just as rigged in casino's favor as always (precisely: house 51.35% vs player 48.65% win probability). 
You can try if yourself with various configurations of starting cash, bet size and exit strategy. Simulations can be repeated
