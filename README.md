# roulette-martingale-simulator

Roulette martingale simulator is an educational GUI app that emulates big numbers of roulette games, in which a player tries his luck using martingale betting system.
Martingale system is straight-forward: you double down after every loss and go back to initial bet after every win. 
It is one of the most popular strategies among gamblers and some of them believe that it actually overturns the odds of winning in player's favor (provided that player has just enough money to double down after every loss to finally get out of losing position with just one win). 
While this strategy can lead to seemingly easy short term returns, it turns out that in the long run game is just as rigged in casino's favor as always (precisely: house 51.35% vs player 48.65% win probability). Keep calm and do the math.
You can try it yourself with various configurations of starting cash, bet size and exit strategy. Simulations can be repeated chosen number of times, so that analyzed sample is big enough to be statistically significant. 
Have fun!
